# Discord Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord bot created to address the common question within your friend group: "Hmm, I wonder when was the last time X person was in Discord?" This bot keeps track of user activity in voice channels and provides a convenient way to inquire about it.

## Features

- Records and maintains data about when members in the server last joined a voice channel.
- Allows users to query the bot to find out when a specific user last joined a voice channel.
- Provides a list of all members who have recently joined voice channels.

## Usage

To interact with the bot, you can use the following commands:

- `@botname last_joined <username>`: This command tells you the last time the specified user joined a voice channel in the server.
- `@botname last_joined`: This command provides a list of all members who have recently joined voice channels. Members who haven't joined recently won't be included.

## Motivation

This project was created as a fun and educational endeavor. The motivations behind its development include:

- Exploring Python programming.
- Gaining experience in building Discord bots.
- Learning how to host a bot on a server, moving beyond local hosting.
